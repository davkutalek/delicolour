**_delicolour_** is a lightweight _colour finder_.

It has only been tested on Linux.

The goal of delicolour is to have a straightforward user experience for
the task of choosing a colour (mainly for web design), not as advanced
as http://www.gpick.org/[Gpick], yet still useful and responsive. The
core principle is: no tabs or other windows, few clicks, everything
instantaneously accessible from the main window.


== Notable features

* Instant updates (moving one slider or modifying one field updates
  the other controls).
* Big colour rectangle showing your two current colours (called _left_
  and _right_).
* Up to four rows of 16 favorite colours at the top (number of rows
  and colours per rows is configurable with command-line options).
* RGB values (0 to 255).
* HSV values (0 to 359 for hue and 0 to 100 for saturation and value).
* Scrollable sliders and entries (hue slider wraps).
* Fine colour adjustment buttons (increase/decrease saturation and
  lightness) with adjustable increment value.
* CSS hex and RGB strings.
* Intelligent copy/paste (paste `\#rrggbb` or `rrggbb` into the hex
  text box and decide if you want to prepend the `#` character when
  copying).
* Useful keyboard shortcuts.

=== Interface

==== Window title

----
delicolour: #bba6de [#184c99]
----

The window title indicates the two current colours. The one being
currently edited is between `[` and `]`.


==== Favorite colours

image::http://ss.0x3b.org/impercipience71.png[]

Favorite colours are little squares at the top of the window which
you can set to the current colour by right-clicking them.

You can set the current colour from a favorite colour by left-clicking
it.

The `-f`/`--fav-colours-count` and `-F`/`--fav-colours-rows-count`
command-line options control the number of available favorite colours.

delicolour does not remember favorite colours once you quit it.


==== The big rectangle

image::http://ss.0x3b.org/poikilothermal774.png[]

The big rectangle below favorite colours shows the two current colours.

A little dot located at the top left or top right corner of the
big rectangle indicates which of the two colours is the one currently
being edited. You can switch to one or the other by clicking the
left or right side of the big rectangle.

You can set the initial left and right colours when you launch
delicolour with one of:

* The first positional argument, for example `delicolour fd487e`. This
  sets both the left and right colours at the same time.

* The `-l`/`--left-colour` and `-r`/`--right-colour` command-line
  options.


==== Fine-tuning controls

image::http://ss.0x3b.org/unuprightly55.png[]

With fine-tuning controls, you can modify the current colour using
buttons to finely increment/decrement parameters.

The control on the left side is the _increment value_. When you press
one of the buttons on the right side, you add/subtract this value
to/from the button's parameter's current value.

The parameters (buttons), from left to right, are:

* Decrease saturation (_S_ in HSV)
* Increase saturation
* Decrease lightness (_L_ in HSL)
* Increase lightness

The increment value also controls the incrementation/decrementation
amount of the sliders when you scroll them with the mouse wheel.

The `-i`/`--increment` command-line option controls the initial
fine-tuning increment value.


==== RGB

The RGB sliders control the amount of red, green, and blue in the
current colour.

You can scroll the sliders and text boxes with the mouse wheel.


==== HSV

image::http://ss.0x3b.org/fuzees835.png[]

The HSV sliders control the hue, saturation, and value or the current
colour.

You can scroll the sliders and text boxes with the mouse wheel. The hue
slider wraps when you scroll its text box.


==== CSS hex

image::http://ss.0x3b.org/overglide667.png[]

The CSS hex text box shows and controls the CSS hexadecimal value of the
current colour.

You can copy the CSS hex value to the clipboard by clicking the text box
and pressing *Ctrl*+*C* (no need to select the whole text). If the
_Copy \#_ option is checked, delicolour preprends a `#` character to
the copied value.

You can paste a CSS hex value, with or without a `#` prefix, by clicking
the text box and pressing *Ctrl*+*V* (no need to select the whole text).

If the _Lowercase_ option is checked, delicolour prints the CSS hex
value in lowercase when updating.


==== CSS RGB

image::http://ss.0x3b.org/nuzzer45.png[]

The CSS RGB text box shows and controls the CSS RGB value of the current
colour.

You can copy the CSS RGB value to the clipboard by clicking the text box
and pressing *Ctrl*+*C* (no need to select the whole text).

You can paste a CSS RGB value, with or without a `#` prefix, by clicking
the text box and pressing *Ctrl*+*V* (no need to select the whole text).
